   The file selected in this example has the file type, project code, milestone, and version in the filename. You
   **DO NOT** have to use this naming convention. Any file you upload will use the inputs you provide in the prompt
   to determine these values.

Then manually enter your project code and version. Also select the appropriate Milestone from the drop down box.
